`small-tdd` is a small and simple library to allow easy assertions in your C and C++ projects. 
You can simply insert it in your projects as it is very lightweight : It only contains a header and a source file.

Choose your language, between C and C++, and simply add it to your project.

To compile with it, simply add the source file as you would for any source file.

For example, ```gcc -o main main.c tdd.c````
